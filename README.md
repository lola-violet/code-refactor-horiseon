UWBC_HW#1 - HTML, CSS &amp; Git

## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to increase the accessibility of the application provided. Accessibility is very important for web applications; not only does it help people with disabilities access the app, but it also helps the app rank higher in search engines & makes code easier to read. 

The finished application is a home page for Horiseon -- a digital marketing company that handles search engine optimization, online repuation management, and social media marketing. Their identifiable customer benefits include lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management. 

The edits I provided have made the site significantly more accessible: people with disabilities will be able to access it, it will rank higher on search engines, and the code is clean, organized, and easy to read. 

## Specific Edits
* A more specific website title
* Alt attributes for all images
* Title attributes for images linked in CSS
* Additional spacing between tags & elements for clarity
* Semantic tags in HTML
* Commented out CSS elements for readability
* Consise CSS elements without unnecessary & overwhelming repetition
